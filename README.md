[EVEXFleet](http://evexfleet.com/)
======

Tracks players in the game EVE Online through the ingame browser. Shows data in real-time to all fleet members and the commander to allow quick analysis of massive amounts of data and fast reaction times as a group. 

Features live data updates and detailed information about every fleet member. Interesting part of the project was writing the client interface - it is able to exploit the user information post headers in the client to push live data updates to the server that are reflected immediately in the commander interface.
